Summary: Happy Hour Go!

Project on GitHub: https://github.com/cit-upenn/cit-591-projects-fall-2016-happy_hour_go

Project Description: Happy Hour Go! application enables users to run an instantaneous search on local bars and restaurants that are currently on happy hour promotions.

- Initial Setup - DataPrep
  - The raw data is obtained from a website: http://philly.thedrinknation.com/. It provides bars with happy hour information and grouped them by weekdays from Monday to Sunday.
  - We were able to download the HTML source code of the website of the 7 pages, and these 7 pages serve as the raw data of our project.
  - The HTML source code of the pages are organized in a pattern that we were able to subtract key information out of them using RegEx and write into 7 clean and organized .csv data format.
  - Yelp API is utilized to obtain latitude and longitude of business addresses, and later used to place markers onto the map

- Search
  - In this part, based on the current time of search request, the correct weekday file is pulled out.
  - Bar objects are constructed and placed into data structure of all relevant Bars with happy hour information.
  - Based on current time, a search is run and result stored.

- GUI - mapMaker
  - JavaFx is used in GUI development.
  - We used an external package GMapsFx that enables us to integrate Google Map API within JavaFx.
  - DataSender class is created to communicate search result from Search with the Geocoding services of GMapsFx to display search results on the map as individual markers.
  - Business data is retrieved from both clean data and Yelp API
  - Specific styling codes were incorporated into the display, including customized Google Map view, marker image, Yelp logo, etc.
  - Use Javax to play sound when clicking marker.

- Yelp API
  - We queried Yelp API to get the restaurants' information such as Yelp URL, address, phone number, and rating. Then we display these information on GUI

- JUnit Test
  - JUnit test covered majority of the program, except for the JavaFx application which is not supposed to be tested using JUnit test.
